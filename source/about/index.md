I am *@Terry* (Guoze, Tang), a graduate student in the [School of Computing](http://www.clemson.edu/ces/computing/) at [Clemson University](http://www.clemson.edu/). I graduated from [Yunnan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan_University) Electronic and Information Engineering in 2014. After that, I studied Software Engineering and graduated from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China) in 03/2017. After two years of study, I acquired a comprehensive knowledge of computer hardware and software. I was interested in embedded systems design. And I gained a lot, not only on specialized knowledge but also a scientific way of thinking.

My work experiences started from 07/2015. I was employed at the Communication Research and Development (R&D) group in Guangzhou [Haige company](http://www.haige.com/en/About81.html?tid=81). Haige is one of the top research & development company in military communication areas in China. I was assigned to the Civil Aviation Communication Developing team and developed control module and [VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP) module which is based on Asterisk. I developed online upgrade programming and the SLP protocol analysis module in six months.

In additon, I had worked in SZ [DJI Technology company](https://www.dji.com/) for one year, an innovation company which based on Fight control. At DJI, I developed Sensor-driven of FJ01 project in DJI and analyzed the data of Sensor. Working on this project helped me hone my programming skills on a real-life problem. Working in the DJI company, it helped me hone my programming skills on a real-life problem.

As we know, in IT field, technologies update very quickly. It is difficult and unnecessary for us to master all of them. So the ability to study rapidly is very important. As a result, I return to Clemson University for my second master degree.
