### Bio

I am *@Terry* (Guoze, Tang), a Graduate Student in the [School of Computing](http://www.clemson.edu/ces/computing/) at [Clemson University](http://www.clemson.edu/). I graduated from [Yunnan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan_University) Electronic and Information Engineering in 2014. After that, I studied Software Engineering and graduated from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China) in 2017.03. After two years of study, I acquired a comprehensive knowledge of computer hardware and software. I was interested in embedded systems design. And I gained a lot, not only on specialized knowledge but also a scientific way of thinking.   

I had worked in SZ DJI Technology company for one year, an innovation company which based on Fight control. At DJI, I developed Sensor-driven of FJ01 project in DJI and analyzed the data of Sensor. Working on this project helped me hone my programming skills on a real-life problem.
