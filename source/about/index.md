Hi, I am *@Terry* (Guoze, Tang), a graduate Student in Clemson University.

I graduated from [Yunnan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan_University) Electronic and Information Engineering by 2014.During my undergraduate study at the Electronics & Information department of Yunnan University, subjects like C-Programming, Signals and Systems, Principles of microcomputer
interested me the most. I was awestruck by the potential of Intel 8086 microprocessor, more so by the manner in which it is faster and more powerful cousins in a decade.  

After that, I studied Software Engineering and graduated from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China) in 2017.03. After two years of study. I acquired a comprehensive knowledge of computer hardware and software. Some of the subjects I studied were Embedded system design, Embedded operating system, Programming and computer systems, Microprocessor architecture, Algorithmic design & analysis as well as programming using different tools. Most of my interests were in the fields related to information systems and sharing of computing power
and resources. I was interested in embedded systems design. And I gained a lot, not only on specialized knowledge but also a scientific way of thinking. I was trying my best to be a diligent person with sincerity and fortitude as my school required.   

My work experiences started from 07, 2015 to 09, 2016. I was employed at the
Communication Research and Development (R&D) group in Guangzhou Haige company. Haige is one of the top research & development company in military communication areas in China. I was assigned to the Civil Aviation Communication Developing team and developed control module and VoIP module which is based on Asterisk. I developed online upgrade programming
and the SLP protocol analysis module in six months. Although I liked the job, embedded software development at HAIGE was a support function. I, therefore, switched to SZ DJI Technology company, an innovation company which based on Fight control. At DJI, I developed Sensor-driven of FJ01 project in DJI and analyzed the data of Sensor. Working on this project helped me hone my programming skills on a real-life problem.

And now, I will study Computer Science in [Clemson University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_University).
