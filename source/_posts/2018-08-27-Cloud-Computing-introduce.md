# Introduce
## What is the Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

## Some keywords

### Five Characteristics

**On-demand self-service**
This means provisioning or de-provisioning computing resources as needed in an automated fashion without human intervention [n. 介入；调停；妨碍]. An analogy to this is electricity as a utility where a consumer can turn on or off a switch on-demand to use as much electricity as required.

**Resource Pooling**
This means that computing resources are pooled to meet the demand of the consumers so that resources (physical or virtual) can be dynamically assigned, reassigned or de-allocated as per the requirement. Generally the consumers are not aware of the exact location of computing resources. However, they may be able to specify location (country, city, region and the like) for their need. For example, I as a consumer might want to host my services with a cloud provider that has cloud data centers within the boundaries of Australia.

**Ubiquitous[adj. 普遍存在的；无所不在的] network access**
This means that computing facilities can be accessed from anywhere over the network using any sort of thin or thick clients (for example smartphones, tablets, laptops, personal computers and so on).

**Elasticity**
Cloud computing provides an illusion of infinite computing resources to the users. In cloud models, resources can be elastically provisioned or released according to demand. 

**Measured service**
This means that consumers only pay for the computing resources they have used. This concept is similar to utilities like water or electricity.


### Three main service models of cloud computing
**SAAS**
Software as a service (SaaS). Applications hosted by a provider on a cloud infrastructure are accessed from thin or thick clients over the network or a program interface (for example, web services). Examples are Google Docs, IBM SmartCloud Docs, IBM SmartCloud Meetings, Saleforce.com’s CRM application and so on.


### PAAS
Platform as a service (PaaS). Providers deliver not only infrastructure but also middleware (databases, messaging engines and so on) and solution stacks for application build, development and deploy. IBM SmartCloud Application Services and Google App Engine are two examples of PaaS.

### IAAS
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). It is the delivery of computing infrastructure as a service. IBM SmartCloud Enterprise+, SoftLayer cloud and Amazon EC2 are some examples of IaaS.

### HAAS
Hardware as a service (HaaS) refers to managed services or grid computing, where computing power is leased from a central provider. In each case, the HaaS model is similar to other service-based models, where users rent, rather than purchase, a provider's tech assets.

### Four cloud deployment models( public/private/hybrid types of clouds)

**Public cloud**

This is where computing resources provided by a cloud provider are used by different organizations through public Internet on a pay as you go (PAYG) model. Cloud providers ensure some sort of separation for resources used by different organizations. This is known as multitenancy [n. 多租户技术].

**Private cloud**

This is where cloud infrastructure is solely owned by an organization and maintained either by this organization or a third party and can be located on site or off-site. Computing resources are behind the corporate firewall.

**Community cloud**

Here, cloud infrastructure is owned and shared by multiple organizations with a shared concern.

**Hybrid cloud**

It is the combination of any type of cloud model mentioned above connected by standardized or proprietary technology.
